					<ul>
						<li>Name:Pandora’s Actor
						<li>Titles: Ever-Changing Faceless Phantom
						<li>Gender: Male
						<li>Race: Doppelganger
						<li>Affiliation: Great Tomb of Nazarick
						<li>Occupation: Area Guardian of the Treasury
						<li>Creator: Momonga
						<li>Total Level: 100
						<li>Racial Level: Doppelganger (15), Greater Doppelganger (10), etc (20)
					
					</ul>
					
					<img src="pic/Pandoras.jpg" class="w3-round" alt="Showing how powerful he is." width="1400" height="500">
					
					<p>In the 9th spot we have the creation of Momonga himself – Pandora’s Actor. Pandora’s Actor is a doppelganger who takes charge of protecting Nazarick’s Treasury and financial management. He is also an interesting figure who dresses like a Nazi-soldier. In addition, he tends to have exaggerated gesture and body language since Momonga thought that it was cool when designing Pandora’s Actor.</p>
					<p>Since Pandora’s Actor reflects Momonga’s younger year of chunnibyou, when transferred to the New World, Momonga feels extremely embarrassed when witnessing his “childish past”. But putting that aside, Pandora’s Actor is an extremely intelligent NPC and he often asks questions even to his creator.</p>
					<p>That said, he is extremely loyal to the supreme leaders, especially Momonga and he always carry out orders precisely without any misunderstanding. He can also give out considerable suggestions depending on different situations.</p>
					<p>In terms of power, his main ability is shape-shifting which allows him to take form of every living being, including even 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown guild. When taking form of a living being, he can uses all the copied being’s skills and abilities up to 80%.</p>
					<p>Therefore, Pandora’s Actor is considerably a very powerful character thanks to his versatility. In the New World, it seems all the Floor Guardians and the Pleiades haven’t met or known much about Pandora’s Actor.</p>
					<p>Therefore, there are quite a number of rumors about him, for example: Albedo claimed that his power even rivals herself and Demiurge mainly because of his intelligence. While Sebas Tian claims that his power is on the same level as all the Floor Guardians.</p>
