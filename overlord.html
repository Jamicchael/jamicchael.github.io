			<h3> What Is Overlord?</h3>

			<p> An online role-playing game takes on a reality of its own after its servers permanently shut down, trapping the only remaining logged-in player as his fearsome lich character who struggles to maintain the fragile balance between the world's races.</p>


		<p> The very first Overlord character we have to talk about is the leader of the infamous guild leader of Ainz Ooal Gown himself: Momonga. Before his reincarnation in the New World, he was a human named Suzuki Satoru.</p> 
		<p> At certain time in his life, his mother died due to overwork, leaving him no family or even outside friends to support him except for his gamer friends in the game YGGDRASIL.</p> 
		<p> After his mysterious reincarnation to the New World, he takes the form of his in-game character Momonga â€“ a powerful skeletal sorcerer and the leader of Ainz Ooal Gown.</p>  
		<p> In season 1, he soon changed his name to Ainz Ooal Gown and hoped to find his comrades if they also got transferred to the New World.</p>
